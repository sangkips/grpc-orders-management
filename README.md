## Distributed Order Processing System

A cloud-native microservice-based system where users can place orders, track order statuses, and analyze trends in real time.
### Tech Stack:
- Golang for all microservices
- gRPC for efficient inter-service communication
- Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling
- Istio for service mesh, observability, and security
- RabbitMQ/Kafka for event-driven architecture
- PostgreSQL/Redis for data storage and caching
- Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring and alerts

### Microservices:
1. Auth Service
  - JWT-based authentication & role-based access control (RBAC)
  - API Gateway with rate limiting

2. Order Service
  - Manages order creation, status updates
  - Emits events for payment & fulfillment

3. Payment Service
  - Processes payments via third-party integration (e.g., Stripe)
  - Listens for order events & updates statuses

4. Inventory Service
  - Manages stock levels, reservations
  - Notifies when items are low

5. Analytics Service
  - Real-time order statistics & trends
  - Uses event data for ML-based demand forecasting

6. Logging & Monitoring Service
  - Centralized logs (ELK/Prometheus + Loki)
